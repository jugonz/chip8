Chip8

Chip8 implements the CHIP-8 interpreted programming language from the 1970's.
CHIP-8 provides a description of the virtual machine that it runs on, and
Chip8 emulates this machine well enough to run many original games for the system
(23 public domain games are included in /c8games).

Chip8 is written in Go and uses OpenGL to display graphics. It relies on
the go-gl and glfw packages for OpenGL support (they should be able to
be installed via go get). When I wrote Chip8, the go-gl package had no explicit
OpenGL version dependency, but now you must explicitly pick a version of OpenGL
to use with it. On my system, this is OpenGL 2.1, but your mileage may vary.
With these packages, Chip8 should be able to run on most systems that are supported by Go.

Chip8 was mostly written in Summer 2014 as a hobby, but its source code is
clean enough to understand.

After it is built, it can be run via
	chip8 -path="path/to/chip8/rom".

Debug mode can be turned on via the -debug flag.

As a final note, CHIP-8 uses a hex keyboard, mapped directly to keys 0-9 and A-F.
This can be changed in gfx/Screen.go.

Happy emulating!
